Use ESLint to find and fix problems in your codebase.
ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. 

Create React App comes with ESLint. [Refer to official documentation for detailed usage. &#8594](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/setting-up-your-editor/#extending-or-replacing-the-default-eslint-config)
