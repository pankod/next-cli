Docker is an open source containerization platform. Docker enables developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components that combine application source code with all the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run the code in any environment.

[Refer to official documentation for detailed usage. &#8594](https://docs.docker.com)

Example Dockerfile:

```js title="Dockerfile"
FROM node:12-alpine

WORKDIR /opt/app

ENV NODE_ENV production

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm ci 

COPY . /opt/app

RUN npm install --dev && npm run build

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

:::note

Dockerfile is created by superplate if you select docker plugin during the project creation phase.
