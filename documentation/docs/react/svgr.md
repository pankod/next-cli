SVGR transforms SVG into ready to use components.  
[Refer to official documentation for detailed usage. &#8594](https://react-svgr.com/docs/getting-started/)

Run the following command to produce components from SVG's.
```ts
npm run svgr
```



This will transform SVG's at `public/icons` to `.tsx` components, puts them in `src/components/icons` ignoring existing ones.

:::caution
After adding new SVG icons, you must run the following command again to produce components for newly added SVG's.
```ts
npm run svgr
````

### Adding SVGR to your project later
:::tip

All this work will be handled automatically by superplate, so you donâ€™t need to do anything extra as long as you choose SVGR plugin during the project creation phase.

:::


If you didn't choose the SVGR plugin during project creation phase, you can follow the instructions below to add it. 

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```
npm install -D @svgr/cli
```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```
yarn add -D @svgr/cli
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Add command to scripts
```ts title="package.json"
{
    scripts: {
        "svgr": "npx @svgr/cli -d src/components/icons --ignore-existing --icon --typescript public/icons"
    }
}
```
Then run the following command
```ts
npm run svgr
```
