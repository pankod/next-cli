Provides performant and powerful data synchronization for React.

React Query is often described as the missing data-fetching library for React, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a breeze.

Refer to [documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for detailed usage.

:::tip

All required configurations will be handled automatically by CLI as long as you choose plugins during the project creation phase.

:::

React Query supports prefetching multiple queries on the server in Next.js and then dehydrating those queries to the queryClient.

To support caching queries on the server and set up hydration:
- Create a new `QueryClient` instance
- Wrap your app component with `<QueryClientProvider>` and pass it the client instance
- Wrap your app component with `<Hydrate>` and pass it the `dehydratedState` prop from `pageProps`.

We recommend to check official [documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for SSR detail.

```js title="pages/_app.js"
import React from 'react';
import { AppProps } from "next/app";
import "@styles/global.css"
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "react-query";
import { Hydrate } from "react-query/hydration";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps): JSX.Element {
    const queryClient = new QueryClient()
    return (
        <Hydrate state={pageProps.dehydratedState}>
            <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
                <Component {...pageProps} />
            </QueryClientProvider>
        </Hydrate>
    );
}

export default MyApp;
```
:::caution

If you didn't choose the plugin during project creation phase, you must update your `main.js` file as above after installing required package to add it.

#### `useQuery` example:

```js title="In your component"
import { useQuery } from "react-query";

const API_URL = "https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/programming/random";

export const ReactQueryExample = () => {

  const { data, refetch } = useQuery("repoData", () => 
    fetch(
      API_URL
    ).then((res) => res.json()),
    {
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
    }
  );
};
```
