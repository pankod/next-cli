SVGR transforms SVG into ready to use components.  
[Refer to official documentation for detailed usage. &#8594](https://react-svgr.com/docs/getting-started/)

Run the following command to produce components from SVG's.
```js
npm run svgr
```



This will transform SVG's at `public/icons` to `.tsx` components, puts them in `src/components/icons` ignoring existing ones.

:::caution
After adding new SVG icons, you must again run the following command again to produce components for newly added SVG's.
```js
npm run svgr
````
